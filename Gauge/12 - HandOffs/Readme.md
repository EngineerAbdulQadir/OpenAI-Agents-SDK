# OpenAI Agents SDK: Handoffs

The **OpenAI Agents SDK** is a versatile toolkit for building AI agents that can interact with users and perform tasks across various domains. A standout feature is **handoffs**, which enable agents to delegate tasks to other specialized agents, streamlining workflows and enhancing efficiency.

## Introduction

The OpenAI Agents SDK empowers developers to create AI agents capable of handling sophisticated tasks. With **handoffs**, agents can pass responsibilities to other agents better suited for specific jobs, such as routing a refund request to a dedicated refund agent in a customer support system.

---

## What Are Handoffs?

**Handoffs** allow an AI agent to transfer a task or conversation to another agent. This is ideal for scenarios where specialization is key, enabling the system to delegate tasks to the most qualified agent. For example, a general-purpose agent might hand off a technical query to a tech support agent.

---

## How Handoffs Work

Handoffs are represented as tools in the language model (LLM). For instance, a handoff to a "Support Agent" might be a tool named `transfer_to_support_agent`. When invoked:

1. The current agent relinquishes control.
2. The specified agent takes over.
3. The new agent inherits the conversation history (unless filtered).

This ensures a smooth transition between agents, maintaining context for the user.

---

## Implementing Handoffs

To use handoffs, define your agents and configure handoffs using the `handoff()` function.

### Basic Example

```python
from agents import Agent, handoff

# Define specialized agents
support_agent = Agent(name="Support Agent", instructions="Handle technical support.")
refund_agent = Agent(name="Refund Agent", instructions="Process refund requests.")

# Define a triage agent with handoffs
triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    instructions="Route requests to the right agent.",
    handoffs=[support_agent, handoff(refund_agent)]
)
```

Here, the `triage_agent` can delegate tasks to either the `support_agent` or `refund_agent`.

---

## Customizing Handoffs

The `handoff()` function offers several options for customization:

- **tool_name_override**: Change the default tool name (e.g., `custom_transfer_to_refund`).
- **tool_description_override**: Customize the toolâ€™s description.
- **on_handoff**: Define a callback function to run during the handoff.
- **input_filter**: Filter the conversation history passed to the next agent.

### Example with Customization

```python
from agents import Agent, handoff, RunContextWrapper

def log_handoff(ctx: RunContextWrapper):
    print("Handoff to Refund Agent triggered.")

custom_handoff = handoff(
    agent=refund_agent,
    tool_name_override="custom_transfer_to_refund",
    tool_description_override="Pass to refund specialist.",
    on_handoff=log_handoff
)

triage_agent = Agent(
    name="Triage Agent",
    handoffs=[support_agent, custom_handoff]
)
```

This example customizes the handoff to the `refund_agent` with a unique tool name and a logging callback.

---

## Best Practices

- **Prompt Guidance**: Include handoff details in agent prompts using `agents.extensions.handoff_prompt.RECOMMENDED_PROMPT_PREFIX` or `prompt_with_handoff_instructions` to help the LLM recognize when to delegate.
- **Input Filtering**: Use filters to pass only relevant data to the next agent, reducing clutter.
- **Testing**: Monitor handoff performance and adjust agent instructions as needed.

## Conclusion

Handoffs in the OpenAI Agents SDK enable the creation of collaborative, specialized agent systems. By delegating tasks effectively, developers can build responsive, user-friendly applications. For more details, see the [official documentation](https://openai.github.io/agents-sdk/docs/handoffs).
