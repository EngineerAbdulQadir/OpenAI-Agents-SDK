# 01 - Introduction of Agents SDK

Welcome to the OpenAI Agents SDK! This introductory section provides an overview of what the SDK is, its core components, and how it empowers you to build intelligent, agentic AI applications with ease.

## What is the OpenAI Agents SDK?

The OpenAI Agents SDK is a lightweight, easy-to-use package designed to help you build agentic AI applications. It represents a production-ready upgrade from the earlier Swarm experimentation for agents. With its minimal abstractions, the SDK enables you to integrate complex AI behaviors seamlessly into your projects.

## Core Primitives

The Agents SDK is built around a small set of powerful primitives:

- **Agents**  
  These are Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with specific instructions and tools, forming the backbone of your AI applications.

- **Handoffs**  
  Handoffs allow agents to delegate specific tasks to other agents, ensuring that each component focuses on its area of expertise.

- **Guardrails**  
  These are mechanisms for validating inputs to agents, ensuring that the data flowing through your system adheres to expected formats and constraints.

## Key Benefits

- **Simplicity and Power**  
  Despite its simplicity, the SDKâ€™s primitives allow you to build complex relationships between tools and agents without a steep learning curve.

- **Integration with Python**  
  Leverage the power of Python to combine these primitives and create sophisticated, real-world applications.

- **Built-in Tracing**  
  The SDK comes with comprehensive tracing capabilities, enabling you to visualize, debug, and evaluate your agentic flows. This also includes features for fine-tuning models to suit your specific application needs.
